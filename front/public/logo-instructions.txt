Logo Design Instructions for AvocatAssist

The logo should represent the legal assistance and AI aspects of the platform:

1. Main Element: A scale of justice (balance) as the central element
   - Scale base at the bottom
   - Vertical stand in the middle
   - Horizontal arm with two dishes hanging from it

2. Additional Elements:
   - A document icon on one side of the scale
   - A brain or AI-related icon on the other side
   - The letter "A" (for AvocatAssist) above the scale
   - A small gavel icon to reinforce the legal theme

3. Colors:
   - Primary color: #0EA5E9 (sky blue from the Tailwind palette)
   - Secondary elements in white or light gray

4. Create two versions:
   - logo.svg - Regular version with blue elements
   - logo-white.svg - White version for dark backgrounds (used in the admin panel)

5. Ensure the logo is:
   - Simple and recognizable at small sizes
   - Balanced in composition
   - Modern and professional looking
   - Works well in both color and monochrome

The logo should convey trust, professionalism, and the blend of legal expertise with modern technology.
